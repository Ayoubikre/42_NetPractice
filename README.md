## Description
**NetPractice** is a practical exploration into the foundational mechanics of computer networking. This project shifts from theoretical study to hands-on configuration, requiring the resolution of 10 increasingly complex networking levels within a simulated environment. The objective is to engineer functional communication pathways across diverse network topologies by precisely managing IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing logic. By diagnosing connectivity issues through simulation logs, this project builds a deep, intuition-based understanding of how data packets traverse routers and gateways to reach their destination.

## Instructions
### Running the Interface
This project uses a simulated training interface accessible via a web browser.
1. **Extraction**: Download the project files and extract them to your chosen folder.
2. **Execution**: Run the `run.sh` script in your terminal to launch the local web server and open the interface.
3. **Manual Backup**: If the script fails, run `python3 -m http.server 49242` and navigate to `http://localhost:49242` in your browser.
4. **Login**: You must enter your intranet login so the system can identify your specific configuration.

### Exporting and Submission
* **Exporting**: Once a level is successfully completed, use the **[Get my config]** button to download the configuration file.
* **Submission**: You must submit exactly **10 configuration files** (one per level) at the root of your Git repository.
* **Defense**: During evaluation, you will be required to complete three random levels within a limited time without external tools.
