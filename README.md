## Description
[cite_start]**NetPractice** is a practical networking exercise designed to introduce the fundamentals of computer communication[cite: 14]. [cite_start]The primary goal is to configure small-scale networks by correctly setting up IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways[cite: 15, 67]. [cite_start]The project consists of 10 levels of increasing difficulty, each requiring the user to resolve connection issues within a simulated environment[cite: 68, 99].


## Description
[cite_start]**NetPractice** is a practical exploration into the foundational mechanics of computer networking[cite: 14]. [cite_start]This project shifts from theoretical study to hands-on configuration, requiring the resolution of 10 increasingly complex networking levels within a simulated environment[cite: 68, 70]. [cite_start]The objective is to engineer functional communication pathways across diverse network topologies by precisely managing IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing logic[cite: 15, 67]. [cite_start]By diagnosing connectivity issues through simulation logs, this project builds a deep, intuition-based understanding of how data packets traverse routers and gateways to reach their destination[cite: 153, 154].

## Instructions
### Running the Interface
[cite_start]This project uses a simulated training interface accessible via a web browser[cite: 70, 71].
1. [cite_start]**Extraction**: Download the project files and extract them to your chosen folder[cite: 76, 77].
2. [cite_start]**Execution**: Run the `run.sh` script in your terminal to launch the local web server and open the interface[cite: 78].
3. [cite_start]**Manual Backup**: If the script fails, run `python3 -m http.server 49242` and navigate to `http://localhost:49242` in your browser[cite: 93].
4. [cite_start]**Login**: You must enter your intranet login so the system can identify your specific configuration[cite: 83, 85].

### Exporting and Submission
* [cite_start]**Exporting**: Once a level is successfully completed, use the **[Get my config]** button to download the configuration file[cite: 139, 145].
* [cite_start]**Submission**: You must submit exactly **10 configuration files** (one per level) at the root of your Git repository[cite: 210, 220].
* [cite_start]**Defense**: During evaluation, you will be required to complete three random levels within a limited time without external tools[cite: 225, 226].

## Resources
### Networking Concepts
To complete these levels, the following concepts were studied and applied:
* [cite_start]**TCP/IP Addressing**: Understanding how unique identifiers are assigned to network devices[cite: 67, 195].
* [cite_start]**Subnet Masks**: Defining the boundaries between the network and host portions of an address[cite: 67, 208].
* [cite_start]**Default Gateways**: Configuring the exit point for data packets traveling to external networks[cite: 67, 208].
* [cite_start]**Routers and Switches**: Learning how hardware manages traffic between different subnets[cite: 194, 208].
* [cite_start]**OSI Model Layers**: Reviewing the conceptual layers of data transmission[cite: 208].

### AI Usage
